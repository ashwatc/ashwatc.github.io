								<h3>Ashwat Chidambaram</h3>
								<p>Born and raised a California native, I'm currently a student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) as a <a href="https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/regents-and-chancellors-scholarship" target="_blank">Regents' and Chancellor's Scholar.</a>
									I'm constantly exploring new ways to learn anything and everything I can, and how I can apply those skills to build cool and purposeful things to use.
									I have a deep interest in pursuing a path which allows me to combine my passions for both software and hardware together, particularly delving into the field of autonomous systems 
									in order to build safe, reliable, and innovative robotics in the future which will empower humanity. In addition, I have a lot of interests far beyond the field of tech, which you can read about below!
								</p>

								<!-- Ever since a young age I've always been interested in the field of aviation. From flying wind-up toy balsawood planes in 5th grade, to flying real Cessna-172s during high school, 
									this passion grew with me. As I began to teach myself how to code in high school, I instantly knew that I wanted to pursue a path in life which would allow me to combine my love for both 
									software and hardware aspects of engineering, focusing on autonomous ground and aerial vehicles. -->

								<h2>Organizations</h2>
								<p>Being a key part of something bigger than myself has always been one of the important things in my life. Here are a few organizations I am extremely fortunate to be a part of 
									during my time at UC Berkeley, due to the amazing experiences I have in them and the truly phenomenal people I get to meet along the way.</p>
									
								<h3>Berkeley Model United Nations (BMUN)</h3>

										<p>
											The oldest Model UN conference in the world, BMUN was founded in 1952 by a small group of students at UC Berkeley. For the better part of a century, BMUN has upheld their legacy through thick and thin. 
											Today, the BMUN secretariat continues to orchestrate one of the largest Model United Nations conferences in the world, bolstered by our educational mission and outreach initiatives.
											My role in BMUN is as a Vice-Chair leading crisis-related committees, as well as serving as the Deputy of Merchandise for the Publications Staff.

									<h2 style="color:#FDB515">My Passions</h2>
									<p>As much as I love coding and creating, my passions extend farther than the eye can see.<br/>
									Here are a few things I take pride in and enjoy doing in my freetime.</p>
								</header>
								<!-- flying, drumming, basketball, origami, boy scouts, mun -->
								<ul class="features">
									<li class="icon fa-paper-plane">
										<h3>Flying</h3>
										<p>Ever since a young age, I've always been interested in the field of aviation. Starting from the fun and simple wind-up balsawood planes back in 3th grade, I eventually grew into flying Cessna 172s during high school, and am currently a solo-certified student pilot.
											I also enjoy flying quadcopters, and even taught quadcopter piloting lessons to various audiences ranging throughout all ages at the Hiller Aviation Museum in San Carlos, CA.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li class="icon solid fa-drum">
										<h3>Drumming</h3>
										<p>From the moment I entered my first drum lesson in 2nd grade, I knew I was getting into a whole lot of fun. Drumming has become one of my favorite lifetime hobbies, and I've performed percussion/drum set in Jazz Bands, Symphonic Bands, and Wind Ensembles for about 10 years.
											Nowadays you can find me casually jamming out on an electronic drum kit back at home, recording drum covers to the latest pop songs which catch my attention on the radio.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li class="icon solid fa-basketball-ball">
										<h3>Basketball</h3>
										<p>Basketball has become a classic sport that I began playing with my friends since we were tiny 5th graders, and it never gets old to this day as college students. Besides playing recreationally,
											I also play Intramural Basketball at Cal representing the Berkeley Model United Nations (BMUN) club, and we had a near-perfect season this past semester (until it was unfortunately cut short due to the pandemic).
										</p>
									</li>
									<li class="icon solid fa-sticky-note">
										<h3>Origami</h3>
										<p>When you start to get bored with writing on paper, you begin to fiddle with it. This is pretty much the story of my life. From simple boats and flapping cranes, to intricate animals and modular planes,
											origami has become a way for me to escape the extremely analytical and quantitative lifestyle of tech and engineering, allowing me to openly express a more creative and free-thinking aspect of my character and mind.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li class="icon solid fa-globe-americas">
										<h3>United Nations</h3>
										<p>Learning about global issues and international affairs has always been of great interest to me, ever since I started competing in Model United Nations in high school.
											It allows me to represent different countries, research their history and resources, and learn about how to compromise and work together with other nations while putting our differences aside.
											I also love to get directly involved, and have previously served as a Delegate at the United Nations Youth Assembly, flying over and attending a conference at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li class="icon solid fa-flag-usa">
										<h3>Boy Scouts of America</h3>
										<p>From the bottom of my heart, I can truly say that nothing has changed my mindset, personality, and character as much as the Boy Scouts of America. The ideals of teamwork, leadership, and responsibility have been 
											deeply instilled within me during my 8 years as a Scout. I earned my Eagle Scout rank along with the Bronze, Gold, and Silver Eagle Palms, was inducted into the Order of the Arrow (Boy Scout's Honor Society), and served in over six different
											leadership roles in my Troop. Once a Scout, always a Scout.
